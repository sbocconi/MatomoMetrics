# MatomoMetrics
This software reads the content of a Matomo DB tracking a particular website and calculates metrics such as average time from one page to another on the website (see figure):

It also displays flows across categories of pages (see figure):

In order to do so, each page on the website needs to be assigned to a particular category.
